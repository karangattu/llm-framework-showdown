## Prompt & Model

**Generator model:** `claude-sonnet-4-6` via [chatlas](https://posit-dev.github.io/chatlas/) `ChatAnthropic` with `tool_web_search()` enabled

**Evaluator model:** `claude-sonnet-4-6` via [Inspect AI](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/)

**Prompt given to the LLM to generate each app:**

> Create an app using **{framework}** that is a basic tip calculator which features a clean interface with input fields for the bill amount and tip percentage (with 15%, 18%, or 20% presets). It must instantly calculate and display the tip amount and the total bill (bill + tip), with an optional, useful feature to split the total among multiple people. Do not use extra packages or CSS or JavaScript other than what {framework} already provides.

The `{framework}` placeholder was filled with each of: **Streamlit**, **Plotly Dash**, **Panel**, and **Shiny for Python**.

## Frameworks Generated

| Framework | Directory | Run Command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Streamlit | `streamlit/` | `streamlit run streamlit/app.py` |
| Plotly Dash | `dash/` | `python dash/app.py` |
| Panel | `panel/` | `panel serve panel/app.py` |
| Shiny for Python | `shiny/` | `shiny run shiny/app.py` |

## Test Scenario

Each app was started, given a bill of **\$85.50** with a **20% tip** split among **3 people**.

## Evaluation with Inspect AI

Each generated app was scored by `claude-sonnet-4-6` (via [Inspect AI](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/)) on three criteria (1--10 scale). The scorer received the full app source code plus before/after screenshots:

- **Maintainability** -- Is the code well-structured, modular, and easy to extend?
- **Readability** -- Is it intuitive to read and idiomatic for the framework?
- **Requirement Adherence** -- Does it meet every specification and do the screenshots confirm it works?

### Score Summary

| Framework | Maintainability | Readability | Adherence |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Streamlit | 8 | 9 | 7 |
| Plotly Dash | 8 | 8 | 10 |
| Panel | 7 | 7 | 9 |
| Shiny for Python | 9 | 9 | 10 |
| **Mean** | **8.00** | **8.25** | **9.00** |
